#[ Nim has mandatory indentation, identation is used to make the code more readable. If you don't know what identation is, you should google it.
i.e. 4 spaces per indentation level, if you don't indent, it will not work 
If you're using any modern code editor like VS code etc it will automatically indent for you.]#
